# aren't-you-a-programmer

"How to deal with a programmer" Layman-oriented guidance

1. people who can code don't necessarily know how to hack, or install or configure a operating system
2. programmers don't necessarily specialise in Office software, nor do they know how to use everything (don't ask "didn't you study this, how to scan QR codes in Line / how to add layers in Photoshop")
3. don't ask "what's the point of doing this, what's the use?" just because you think programming is boring
4. don't ask "could you make a massive game?", we rarely know both of how to model, design, maintain, and plan, and even more rarely can do all of them alone
5. do not think all programmers know machine learning
